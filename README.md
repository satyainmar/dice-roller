# dice-roller

This is a simple program which use rand functions to generate the random option and basing on the option roll the dice
generate the randomly generated number

The idea is to focus on the RSpec test coverage and limit the scope of it rather than building to a CLI/UI app

To run the test:

1. Clone github repo
2. Run `bundle install`
3. Run `bundle exec rspec`

To run the program

1. Clone github repo
2. Run `bundle install`
3. Run `ruby lib/dice_roller.rb`
